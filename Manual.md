## Usage

Once you have launched the **Replace Character** application, you will be presented with a simple and intuitive user interface that includes various input fields and buttons. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the application:

   - To perform replacements in multiple files within a directory, click the "Select Directory" button and navigate to the target directory using the directory selection dialog. The application will recursively search for files within the selected directory and its subdirectories.

2. Entering Replacement Parameters:

   - In the "Enter character to replace" field, specify the character you want to replace in the file names. You can enter only one character at a time.

   - In the "Enter new character" field, provide the new character that will replace the old character in the file names. Similar to the previous field, only one character can be entered.

   - Optionally, you can use the "Enter word to remove" field to specify a word that should be removed from the file names.

3. Performing Character Replacements:

   - Once you have entered the required parameters, click the "Replace" button to initiate the character replacements. The application will update the file names based on the specified criteria.

4. Clearing Input Fields:

   - To clear all input fields and start fresh, click the "Clear" button. This will reset the "Enter character to replace," "Enter new character," and "Enter word to remove" fields.

5. Exiting the Application:

   - To exit the **Replace Character** application, simply click the "Exit" button. This will close the application window.
